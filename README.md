# All of the Birthdays

Not everyone has Facebook

### What is this?

Not everyone has Facebook, or wants to have their actual date of birth listed.. big brother and all that.

This is a list of all the people I actually care about, infact I had a group of friends, partners and children listed so that at any point, we could all check it and see if/when it was someone's birthdays and who was buying the first round.

### How do I use it?

`/` shows the next's birthday

`/?f=<firstName>` searches for everyone with that first name

`/?s=<surname>` searches for everyone with that family name (partners and children)

`/all` defaults to the entire list of people and birthdays
